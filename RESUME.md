## Anonymized resume

_References and contact information available on request._

Systems engineer specializing in monitoring and observability. I believe
Conway’s law is apt: systems mirror the communication structures surrounding
them. Using that adage as a guide, I enjoy weaning systems and teams out of
“hand holding” phases. Systems can be self-sufficient by adding monitoring,
alerting, consistency, commentary, doing through audits, and asking questions.

Over the last 10 years I’ve accrued experience from startups, small to medium
business support, and international companies. I’m well versed in Python, Bash
(sed/awk) and git, and am comfortable with Agile/Scrum methodologies. I’m
looking for an engineering team that needs someone who can take on complex,
specialized, projects in need of organization, but I am also very comfortable
with structured tasks and typical systems engineering duties.

I hope to one day be a mentor to other engineers so I can continue to pass down
knowledge of UNIX and networking as was done to me. My goal is to know what is
going on – not just keep guessing.
